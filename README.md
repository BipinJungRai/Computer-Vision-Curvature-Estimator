# Computer-Vision-Curvature-Estimator
Computer Vision Curvature Estimator Computer Vision Curvature Estimator is a Python-based tool for analyzing the curvature of contours in images. It processes an input image, detects edges, identifies the largest contour, estimates its curvature, and visualizes the results. The curvature data is also saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
